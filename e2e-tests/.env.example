# E2E Test Environment Configuration
# This file overrides values from the parent .env for test-specific needs
#
# IMPORTANT: Most configuration is inherited from ../. env
# Only override values that need to be different for tests
#
# Copy this file to .env and customize if needed

# Database Configuration
# Tests run on the host machine, so we connect to localhost instead of the Docker network name
# This is typically the ONLY value you need to override
DB_HOST=localhost
