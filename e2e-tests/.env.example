# E2E Test Environment Configuration
# This file overrides values from the parent .env for test-specific needs
#
# IMPORTANT: Most configuration is inherited from ../.env
# Only override values that need to be different for tests
#
# Copy this file to .env and customize if needed

# Database Configuration
# Tests run on the host machine, so we connect to localhost instead of the Docker network name
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306

# Database credentials (DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD) are automatically added by setup-tests.sh
# They are retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager and written to this file
# DO NOT manually set these values - they will be overwritten

# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://localhost:3001
WEB_BASE_URL=https://localhost:3443
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=https://localhost:3443
