# Green Environment Configuration
# Extends docker-compose.yml for green environment (canary deployment)
# Usage: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.green.yml -p echobase-green up -d
#
# NOTE: Base docker-compose.yml has no port mappings. Port definitions are in:
#   - docker-compose.override.yml (devlocal ports, auto-loaded locally)
#   - docker-compose.ci-blue.yml (CI blue ports, explicit in CI)
#   - docker-compose.green.yml (green ports, explicit in CI)
# This allows all three environments to run simultaneously without conflicts.
#
# IMPORTANT: The green environment connects to the CI durable database.
# Before starting, ensure the CI durable infrastructure is running:
#   ./durable/setup.sh ci
