1.769 npm error code EUSAGE
1.769 npm error
1.769 npm error The `npm ci` command can only install with an existing package-lock.json or
1.769 npm error npm-shrinkwrap.json with lockfileVersion >= 1. Run an install with npm@5 or
1.769 npm error later to generate a package-lock.json file, then try again.

We previously moved all of the package-lock.json files to the root level. Please change the docker build to reference that.
