Nginx is giving a 500 after login to prometheus. I suspect it isn't getting the env var properly since I'm also getting these errors when I run start (And the variables it says aren't set are part of the encrypted password)

---

Let's skip .env.secrets altogether and just read from the environment

---

./start.sh should still check for HTPASSWD_CONTENTS and fail fast with the same messages as before

---

After login, https://localhost:443/prometheus/ reroutes to localhost/prometheus without the port, and gives a 500 error

---

Same behavior. How to check the nginx logs to see if the login was accepted?

---

1. Let's make sure that will work in ci as well

---

Nothing should be running as root in any of the subsystems

---

Now prometheus logs in correctly and so does jaeger but jaeger returns a blank page with some scripts and this html. Is it not loading content for some reason?   <body>
    <div id="jaeger-ui-root"></div>
    <!--
      This file is the main entry point for the Jaeger UI application.
      See https://vitejs.dev/guide/#index-html-and-project-root for more information
      on how asset references are managed by the build system.
    -->

---

Why did it work before we added the nginx auth?

---

On signin to jaeger I get 502 Bad Gateway

---

https://localhost:443/jaeger/ after login redirects to https://localhost/jaeger/ and gets 502 bad gateway

---

Let's follow the standard best practice

---

durable:setup-ci fails with Error response from daemon: Mounts denied: 
The path /builds/tkersh/echobase/otel/jaeger-config.yaml is not shared from the host and is not known to Docker.

---

Please check if there might be other issues and resolve them

---

Wait -- CI pipeline should read HTPASSWD_CONTENTS from gitlab variables. CI does need a persistent password since the admins will be using the UIS.

---

durable:setup-ci fails with ERROR: HTPASSWD_CONTENTS GitLab CI/CD variable is not set.
but that variable is clearly set in gitlab as a project variable

---

I don't see "Expand variable reference"

---

Is this what should be off: Access protected resources in merge request pipelines
Make protected CI/CD variables and runners available in merge request pipelines. Protected resources will only be available in merge request pipelines if both the source and target branches of the merge request are protected. Learn more.

Allow merge request pipelines to access protected variables and runners
