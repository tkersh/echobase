# Work Log

This file logs completed work and in-progress tickets. Keep it simple - just enough to remember what was done. Full details live in your ticket system.

## Format

Each entry should include:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Ticket ID (if applicable)
- Brief description (1-2 lines)
- Status (completed, in-progress, blocked)
- URL to ticket (if available)

Clean out old entries periodically (3+ months).
